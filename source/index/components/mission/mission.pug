            p The mission is to fuel free development. Better said to fuel the individual developers.
            
            p It is to set up effective non-distractive and uncorruptable ways of funding, build powerful developer tools and well connect the developers. Increasing the effectiveness of these developers to contribute to the ecosystem which keeps us all well alive.

            p I want to create a safe space, where we may relax and connect with people who share this mission to furtherly evolve the free ecosystem together. Where we may do research and learn - then act out of reason.

            p In this Mission statement I use the word "free" very similar how Richard Stallman defines it - maybe a bit more generalized. 
            
            p It is the main point that we stay active creators with the capability to modify, understand and extend our tools. That to better avoid becoming the tool.<br>
                b The point is to empower people to experience life from an active hero perspective.

            p From within this safe space the barrier for mere mortals shall feel nonexistent. Permissionlessness and the mindset of failing fast, often and safe are important. Regarding the attempt and the experiment as the only direct growth opportunity is the key.
            
            p Many more people could then join this journey of life-long learning.

            p We develop the Void as the Void is the undefined pointer.
            p We cannot define a specific thing to develop which would satisfy the desired trajectory. 
            p We just know that we need to develop. And we need to develop together.
            p We need to develop to evolve.
