            h1 Our Values
            p We see ourselves living in a crucial moment in human history.
            p Our most recent biggest problems show us our own responsibility in our evolution and that it does not dissappear nor is less relevant in peaceful times.
            p Our base culture - the values we live by and reflect into every aspect of our life -  is the first thing we are responsible for. <i>We have to protect it from the influence and corruption by evil forces.</i>

            p We see that every being has it's right on dignity and general wellbeing.
            p We know that this means we need to hold our own dignity well up and take responsibility over our own wellbeing first.
            p And in our action we donot commit any deeds for the sake of diminishing someone else' dignity or wellbeing.

            p We donot reap the harvest to the maximum such that less may regrow the next year.
            p We leave things better than before we were here.
            p Encourage children to evolve into capable human beings with a strong and helpful set of values.

            p Deep down we are all capable of reason. Only on the surface we are often in a fight - especially in discussions or when we feel like being in a tribal war.

            p With reason we tolarate our hated neighour, defuse our jealousy and greed.<br>
                | With reason we may all act appropriately without a behavioural guide or authoritarian enforcement.

                | We are not fully in control. The idea that we should be is an exaggerated demand - and we will gracefully deal with it.
