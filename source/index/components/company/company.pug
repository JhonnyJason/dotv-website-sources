            h2 Funding
            p All initial funds for .V come out of my pocket. It is set up in such a way that it is neither dependent on customers, nor on further investors to fuel the basic activities.
            p This seems necessary as it appears to me that both, satisfying customers as well as satisfying investors is a dangerously corruptive influence.
