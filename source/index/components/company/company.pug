            h2 Funding
            p All initial Funds for the Company come out of my pocket. The Company is set up in such a way that it is neither dependent on customers, nor on further investors to fuel the company.
            p This seems necessary as it appears to me that both - satisfying customers as well as satisfying investors - is a dangerously corruptive influence.
            p I will keep it that way to stay true to the mission to the farthest extend I am capable of.
